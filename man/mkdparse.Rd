\arguments{
\item{file}{File name of grammer to parse.}

\item{outputFile}{Output file name.  Can be a directory.  If so,
the file name is determined by the input file.}

\item{set_op_priority_from_rule}{Toggle setting of operator
priority from rules.  Setting of operator priorities on
operator tokens can increase the size of the tables but can
permit unnecessary parse stacks to be pruned earlier. (FALSE
by default)}

\item{right_recursive_BNF}{Toggle use of right recursion for EBNF
productions.  Do not change this unless you really know what
you are doing. (FALSE by default)}

\item{states_for_whitespace}{Toggle computing whitespace states.
If 'whitespace' is defined in the grammar, then use it as a
subparser to consume whitespace. (TRUE by default)}

\item{states_for_all_nterms}{Toggle computing states for all
non-terminals.  Ensures that there is a unique state for each
non-terminal so that a subparsers can be invoked for that
non-terminal. (FALSE by default)}

\item{tokenizer}{Toggle building of a tokenizer for START.  When
TRUE, instead of generating a unique scanner for each state
(i.e. a 'scannerless' parser), generate a single scanner
(tokenizer) for the entire grammar.  This provides an easy way
to build grammars for languages which assume a tokenizer
(e.g. ANSI C). (FALSE by default)}

\item{token_type}{Token type "#define" or "enum"}

\item{longest_match}{Toggle longest match lexical ambiguity
resolution.  When TRUE the scanner only recognizing the
longest matching tokens in a given state. This provides an
easy way to build grammars for languages which use longest
match lexical ambiguity resolution (e.g. ANSI-C, C++). (FALSE
by default)}

\item{grammar_ident}{Tag for grammar data structures so that
multiple sets of tables can be included in one
file/application. (defaults to 'gram')}

\item{ident_from_filename}{Build the grammer tag from the
file-name.}

\item{scanner_blocks}{Number of blocks to which scanner tables are
broken up into. Larger numbers permit more sharing with more
overhead.  4 seems to be optimal for most grammars. (defaults
to 4) files.}

\item{write_line_directives}{Toggle writing of line numbers.  Used
to debug the parsing table generator itself. (TRUE by default)}

\item{write_header}{Write header, FALSE : no, TRUE : yes,
"IfEmpty" : only if not empty.}

\item{rdebug}{Replace all actions in the grammar with actions
printing productions, 1 : during the speculative parsing
process (<-), 2 : when reduction is part of any legal final
parse (<=), 3 : both, 4 : remove all actions from the grammar.
Print the changed grammar to console.  Useful for debugging or
prototyping new, experimental grammars.}

\item{verbose}{Increase verbosity.}

\item{write_extension}{Set the extension of the generated code
file.  For C++ programs (for example) the extension can be set
to .cpp with the option \code{write_extension="cpp"}.
(\code{write_extension="c"} by default)}

\item{use_r_header}{when TRUE, add R headers and swap printf for
Rprintf. By default this is TRUE.}

\description{
Make a dparser c file based on a grammer
}
\details{
Uses a grammer file to create a c file for parsing.

 mkdparser is a scannerless GLR parser generator based on the
 Tomita algorithm. It is self-hosted and very easy to
 use. Grammars are written in a natural style of EBNF and regular
 expressions and support both speculative and final actions.
}
\section{Creating a Grammar for Parsing}{

\describe{
\item{Grammar Comments:}{Grammars can include C/C++ style comments

 \bold{Example:}
\preformatted{
// My first grammar
E: E '+' E | "[abc]";
/* is this right? */
}}
\item{Grammar Productions:}{

A production is the parts of your language your are trying to parse and are tpyically named.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_parsing

\itemize{

\item The first production is the root of your grammar (what you
will be trying to parse).

\item Productions start with the non-terminal being defined
   followed by a colon ':', a set of right hand sides separated by
   '|' (or) consisting of elements (non-terminals or terminals).

\item Elements can be grouped with parens '(', and the normal
regular expression symbols can be used ('+' '*' '?' '|').

\item Elements can be grouped with parens '(', and the normal
regular expression symbols can be used ('+' '*' '?' '|').

\item Elements can be repeated using '@', for example elem@3 or
elem@1:3 for repeat 3 or between 1 and 3 times respectively.
}

\bold{Example:}
\preformatted{
 program: statements+ |  comment* (function |  procedure)?;
}

 \bold{Note:} Instead of using '[' ']' for optional elements we
 use the more familar and consistent '?' operator.  The square
 brackets are reserved for speculative actions (below).
}
\item{Global C code in Grammars:}{

 Since the main parsing of the language grammar is in C, intermixing C code with the grammar can be useful.

\itemize{\item Global (or static) C code can be intermixed with productions by surrounding the code with brackets '\{\}'.}

\bold{Example:}
\preformatted{
  \{ void dr_s() \{ printf("Dr. S\n"); \}
   S: 'the' 'cat' 'and' 'the' 'hat' \{ dr_s(); \} | T;
   \{ void twain() \{ printf("Mark Twain\n"); \}
       T: 'Huck' 'Finn' \{ twain(); \};
}

\bold{Note:} When parsing the grammar using
\code{\link{mkdparse}}, the option \code{use_r_header = TRUE} will
redefine \code{printf} to \code{Rprintf} to better
comply with R packages.
}
\item{Terminals}{

The terminals are the peices of the language that are being parsed, like language keywords.

\itemize{\item Strings terminals are surrounded with single quotes.  For example:}

\preformatted{
block: '\{' statements* '\}';
whileblock: 'while' '(' expression ')' block;
}
\itemize{\item Unicode literals can appear in strings or as charaters with U+ or u+.  For example:}

\preformatted{
U+03c9 \{ printf("omega\n"); \}
}
}

\itemize{\item  Regular expressions are surrounded with double quotes.  For example:}
\preformatted{
hexint: "(0x|0X)[0-9a-fA-F]+[uUlL]?";
}
\bold{Note:}  only the simple regular expression operators are currently supported. This include parens, square parens, ranges, and '*', '+', '?'.
\itemize{\item  Terminal modifiers}{

Terminals can contain embbed escape codes.  Including the standard
C escape codes, the codes \\x and \\d permit inserting hex and
decimal ASCII characters directly.

Tokens can be given a name by appending the $name option.  This is useful when you have several
tokens which which represent the same string (e.g. ',').   For example,

\preformatted{
function_call: function '(' parameter ( ',' $name 'parameter_comma' parameter) ')';
}

It is now possible to use $0.symbol == ${string parameter_comma} to differentiate ParseNode ($0) between
a parameter comma node and say an initialization comma.

Terminals ending in '/i' are case insensitive.  For example 'hi'/i
matches 'HI', 'Hi' and "hI' in addition to 'hi'.

\itemize{\item External (C) Scanners}

There are two types of external scanners, those which read a
single terminal, and those which are global (called for every
terminal).  Here is an example of a scanner for a single terminal.
Notice how it can be mixed with regular string terminals.

\preformatted{
\{
    extern char *ops;
    extern void *ops_cache;
    int ops_scan(char *ops, void *ops_cache, char **as,
                 int *col, int *line, unsigned short *op_assoc, int *op_priority);
\}

X: '1' ($\{scan ops_scan(ops, ops_cache)\} '2')*;

}

The user provides the 'ops_scan' function.  This example is from tests/g4.test.g in the source distribution.

The second type of scanner is a global scanner:
\preformatted{
\{
   #include "g7.test.g.d_parser.h"
   int myscanner(char **s, int *col, int *line, unsigned short *symbol,
                 int *term_priority, unsigned short *op_assoc, int *op_priority)
   \{
       if (**s == 'a') \{
           (*s)++;
           *symbol = A;
           return 1;
       \} else if (**s == 'b') \{
           (*s)++;
           *symbol = BB;
           return 1;
       \} else if (**s == 'c') \{
           (*s)++;
           *symbol = CCC;
           return 1;
       \} else if (**s == 'd') \{
           (*s)++;
           *symbol = DDDD;
           return 1;
       \} else
           return 0;
   \}
   $\{scanner myscanner\}
   $\{token A BB CCC DDDD\}

   S: A (BB CCC)+ SS;
   SS: DDDD;
}

Notice how the you need to include the header file generated by
\code{\link{mkdparse}} which contains the token definitions.

\itemize{\item Tokenizers}

Tokenizers are non-context sensitive global scanners which produce
only one token for any given input string.  Some programming
languages (for example C) are easier to specify using a tokenizer
because (for example) reserved words can be handled simply by
lowering the terminal priority for identifiers.
\preformatted{
S : 'if' '(' S ')' S ';' | 'do' S 'while' '(' S ')' ';' | ident;
ident: "[a-z]+" $term -1;
}

The sentence: \bold{if ( while ) a;} is legal because \bold{while}
cannot appear at the start of \bold{S} and so it doesn't conflict
with the parsing of \bold{while} as an \bold{ident} in that
position.  However, if a tokenizer is specified, all tokens will
be possible at each position and the sentense will produce a
syntax error.

\bold{DParser} provides two ways to specify tokenizers: globally
as an option (-T) to \code{\link{mkdparse}} and locally with a $\{declare
tokenize ...\} specifier (see the ANSI C grammar for an example).
The $\{declare tokenize ...\} declartion allows a tokenizer to be
specified over a subset of the parsing states so that (for
example) ANSI C could be a subgrammar of another larger grammar.
Currently the parse states are not split so that the productions
for the substates must be disjoint.

\itemize{\item Longest Match}

 Longest match lexical ambiguity resolution is a technique used by
 separate phase lexers to help decide (along with lexical
 priorities) which single token to select for a given input
 string.  It is used in the definition of ANSI-C, but not in C++
 because of a snafu in the definition of templates whereby
 templates of templates (List<List <Int>>) can end with the right
 shift token
 ('>>').  Since \bold{DParser} does not have a separate lexical phase, it
 does not require longest match disambiguation, but provides it as an option.

There are two ways to specify longest match disabiguation:
globally as an option (-l) to make_dparser or locally with with a
${declare longest_match ...}.  If global longest match
disambiguation is \bold{ON}, it can be locally disabled with {$declare
all_matches ...} .  As with Tokenizers above, local declarations
operate on disjoint subsets of parsing states.
}
\item{Priorities and Associativity:}{
 Priorities can very from MININT to MAXINT and are specified as integers.  Associativity can take the values:
\preformatted{
assoc : '$unary_op_right' | '$unary_op_left' | '$binary_op_right'
| '$binary_op_left' | '$unary_right' | '$unary_left'
| '$binary_right' | '$binary_left' | '$right' | '$left' ;
}
\itemize{\item Token Prioritites}

Termininal priorities apply after the set of matching strings has
been found and the terminal(s) with the highest priority is
selected.

Terminal priorities are introduced after a terminal by the
specifier \bold{$term}.  We saw an example of token priorities
with the definition of \bold{ident}.

\bold{Example:}\preformatted{
S : 'if' '(' S ')' S ';' | 'do' S 'while' '(' S ')' ';' | ident;
ident: "[a-z]+" $term -1;
}
\itemize{\item Operator Priorities}

Operator priorities specify the priority of a operator symbol
(either a terminal or a non-terminal).  This corresponds to the
yacc or bison %left etc. declaration.  However, since DParser is
doesn't require a global tokenizer, operator priorities and
associativities are specified on the reduction which creates the
token.  Moreover, the associativity includes the operator usage as
well since it cannot be infered from rule context.  Possible
operator associativies are:
\preformatted{
operator_assoc : '$unary_op_right' | '$unary_op_left' | '$binary_op_right'
                    | '$binary_op_left' | '$unary_right' | '$unary_left'
                    | '$binary_right' | '$binary_left';
}
\bold{Example:}\preformatted{
E: ident op ident;
ident: '[a-z]+';
op: '*' $binary_op_left 2 |
    '+' $binary_op_left 1;
}

\itemize{\item Rule Priorities}
Rule priorities specify the priority of the reduction itself and have the possible associativies:
\preformatted{
rule_assoc: '$right' | '$left';
}

Rule and operator priorities can be intermixed and are interpreted
at run time (not when the tables are built).  This make it
possible for user-defined scanners to return the associativities
and priorities of tokens.

}
\item{Actions: }{
Actions are the bits of code which run when a reduction occurs.
Example
\preformatted{
 S: this | that;
 this: 'this' \{ printf("got this\n"); \};
 that: 'that' \{ printf("got that\n"); \};
}
\itemize{\item Speculative Action}

  Speculative actions occur when the reduction takes place during
  the speculative parsing process.  It is possible that the
  reduction will not be part of the final parse or that it will
  occur a different number of times.  For example:

\preformatted{
S: this | that;
this: hi 'mom';
that: ho 'dad';
ho: 'hello' [ printf("ho\n"); ];
hi: 'hello' [ printf("hi\n"); ];
}

Will print both 'hi' and 'ho' when given the input 'hello dad' because at the time hello is reduced, the following token is not known.

\itemize{\item Final Actions}

  Final actions occur only when the reduction must be part of any
  legal final parse (committed).  It is possible to do final
  actions during parsing or delay them till the entire parse tree
  is constructed (see Options).  Final actions are executed in
  order and in number according the the single final unambiguous
  parse.

\preformatted{
 S: A S 'b' | 'x';
 A: [ printf("speculative e-reduce A\n"); ]
    \{ printf("final e-reduce A\n"); \};
}
   On input:
\preformatted{
 xbbb
}
   Will produce:
\preformatted{
 speculative e-reduce A
 final e-reduce A
 final e-reduce A
 final e-reduce A
}

\itemize{\item Embedded Actions}

  Actions can be embedded into rule. These actions are executed as
  if they were replaced with a synthetic production with a single
  null rule containing the actions.  For example:

\preformatted{
 S: A \{ printf("X"); \} B;
 A: 'a' \{ printf("a"); \};
 B: 'b' \{ printf("b"); \};
}
  On input:
\preformatted{
ab
}

   Will produce:
\preformatted{
 aXb
}
 Note that in the above example, the print("X") is evaluated in a context null rule context while in:
\preformatted{
 S: A (A B \{ printf("X"); \}) B;
}

The print is evalated in the context of the "A B" subrule because
it appears at the end of the subrule and is therefor treated as a
normal action for the subrule.

\itemize{\item Pass Actions}

DParser supports multiple pass compilation.  The passes are
declared at the top of the grammar, and the actions are associated
with individual rules.

\bold{Example;}
\preformatted{
 $\{pass sym for_all postorder\}
 $\{pass gen for_all postorder\}

 translation_unit: statement*;

 statement
   : expression ';' \{
     d_pass($\{parser\}, &$n, $\{pass sym\});
     d_pass($\{parser\}, &$n, $\{pass gen\});
   \}
   ;

 expression :  integer
   gen: \{ printf("gen integer\n"); \}
   sym: \{ printf("sym integer\n"); \}
   | expression '+' expression $right 2
   sym: \{ printf("sym +\n"); \}
   ;
}

A pass name then a colon indicate that the following action is
associated with a particular pass. Passes can be either for_all or
for_undefined (which means that the automatic traversal only
applies to rules without actions defined for this pass).
Furthermore, passes can be postorder, preorder, and manual (you
have to call d_pass yourself).  Passes can be initiated in the
final action of any rule.

\itemize{\item Default Actions}

  The special production "_" can be defined with a single rule
  whose actions become the default when no other action is
  specified.  Default actions can be specified for speculative,
  final and pass actions and apply to each separately.

\bold{Example}
\preformatted{
 _: \{ printf("final action"); \}
     gen: \{ printf("default gen action"); \}
     sym: \{ printf("default sym action"); \}
     ;
}
}
\item{Attributes and Action Specifiers}{

Each of the language parser can have some global atrributes and actions associated with each part of the parsed code.

\itemize{\item  Global State ($g)}

  Global state is declared by define'ing D_ParseNode_Globals (see the ANSI C grammar for a similar declaration for symbols). Global state can be accessed in any action with $g.  Because DParser handles ambiguous parsing global state can be accessed on different speculative parses.  In the future automatic splitting of global state may be implemented (if there is demand). Currently, the global state can be copied and assigned to $g to ensure that the changes made only effect subsequent speculative parses derived from the particular parse.

  \bold{Example}
\preformatted{
  [ $g = copy_globals($g);
  $g->my_variable = 1;
  ]
}
  The symbol table (see below) can be used to manage state information safely for different speculative parses.

\itemize{\item Parse Node State}

  Each parse node includes a set of system state variables and can have a set of user-defined state variables.  User defined parse node state is declared by define'ing D_ParseNodeUser. The size of the parse node state must be passed into new_D_Parser() to ensure that the appropriate amount of space is allocated for parse nodes.   Parse node state is accessed with:

  \describe{
    \item{$# }{number of child nodes}
    \item{$$ }{user parse node state for parent node (non-terminal defined by the production)}
    \item{$X (where X is a number) }{the user parse node state of element X of the production}
    \item{$n }{the system parse node state of the rule node}
    \item{$nX }{the system parse node state of element X of the production}
  }

  The system parse node state is defined in dparse.h which is installed with DParser.  It contains such information as the symbol, the location of the parsed string, and pointers to the start and end of the parsed string.

\itemize{\item Misc}

\describe{
  \item{$\{scope\} }{the current symbol table scope}
  \item{$\{reject\} }{in speculative actions permits the current parse to be rejected}
}
}
\item{Symbol Table}{

  The symbol table can be updated down different speculative paths while sharing the bulk of the data.  It defines the following functions in the file (dsymtab.h):
  \preformatted{
  struct D_Scope *new_D_Scope(struct D_Scope *st);
  struct D_Scope *enter_D_Scope(struct D_Scope *current, struct D_Scope *scope);
  D_Sym *NEW_D_SYM(struct D_Scope *st, char *name, char *end);
  D_Sym *find_D_Sym(struct D_Scope *st, char *name, char *end);
  D_Sym *UPDATE_D_SYM(struct D_Scope *st, D_Sym *sym);
  D_Sym *current_D_Sym(struct D_Scope *st, D_Sym *sym);
  D_Sym *find_D_Sym_in_Scope(struct D_Scope *st, char *name, char *end);
  }
  'new_D_Scope' creates a new scope below 'st' or NULL for a 'top level'
  scope.  'enter_D_Scope' returns to a previous scoping level.  NOTE: do
  not simply assign $\{scope\} to a previous scope as any updated symbol
  information will be lost.  'commit_D_Scope' can be used in final
  actions to compress the update list for the top level scope and
  improve efficiency.

  'find_D_Sym' finds the most current version of a symbol in a given
  scope.  'UPDATE_D_SYM' updates the value of symbol (creates a
  difference record on the current speculative parse path).
  'current_D_Sym' is used to retrive the current version of a symbol,
  the pointer to which may have been stored in some other attribute or
  variable.  Symbols with the same name should not be created in the
  same scope.  The function 'find_D_Sym_in_Scope' is provided to detect
  this case.

  User data can be attached to symbols by \bold{define}'ing \bold{D_UserSym}.  See the ANSI C grammar for an example.

  Here is a full example of scope usage (from tests/g29.test.g):
  \preformatted{

  #include <stdio.h>

  typedef struct My_Sym \{
    int value;
  \} My_Sym;
  #define D_UserSym My_Sym
  typedef struct My_ParseNode \{
    int value;
    struct D_Scope *scope;
  \} My_ParseNode;
  #define D_ParseNode_User My_ParseNode
\}

dentifier: "[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*";
}}
\item{Whitespace}{

   Whitespace can be specified two ways: C function which can be
   user-defined, or as a subgrammar.  The default whitespace parser is
   compatible with C/C++ #line directives and comments.  It can be
   replaced with any user specified function as a parsing option (see
   Options).

   Additionally, if the (optionally) reserved production \bold{whitespace} is
   defined, the subgrammar it defines will be used to consume whitespace
   for the main grammar.  This subgrammar can include normal actions.

 \bold{Example}
\preformatted{
: 'a' 'b' 'c';
hitespace: "[ \t\n]*";
}

   Whitespace can be accessed on a per parse node basis using the
unctions: \bold{d_ws_before} and \bold{d_ws_after}, which return the
tart of the whitespace before start_loc.s and after end respectively.

} \item{Ambiguities}{

   Ambiguities are resolved automatically based on priorities and
   associativities.  In addition, when the other resolution techniques
   fail, user defined ambiguity resolution is possible.  The default
   ambiguity handler produces a fatal error on an unresolved ambiguity.
   This behavior can be replaced with a user defined resolvers the
   signature of which is provided in dparse.h.

   If the \bold{verbose_level} flag is set, the default ambiguity
andler will print out parenthesized versions of the ambiguous parse
rees.  This may be of some assistence in disambiguating a grammar.
}
\item{Error Recovery}{

   DParser implements an error recovery scheme appropriate to scannerless parsers.  I haven't had time to investigate all the prior work in this area, so I am not sure if it is novel.  Suffice for now that it is optional and works well with C/C++ like grammars.
 }
 \item{Parsing Options}{
   Parser are instantiated with the function new_D_Parser.  The
   resulting data structure contains a number of user configurable
   options (see dparser.h).  These are provided reasonable default
   values and include:
   \itemize{
     \item \bold{initial_globals} - the initial global variables accessable through $g
     \item \bold{initial_skip_space_fn} - the initial whitespace function
     \item \bold{initial_scope} - the initial symbol table scope
     \item \bold{syntax_error_fn} - the function called on a syntax error
     \item \bold{ambiguity_fn} - the function called on an unresolved ambiguity
     \item \bold{loc} - the initial location (set on an error).
   }
   In addtion, there are the following user configurables:
   \itemize{
     \item \bold{sizeof_user_parse_node} - the sizeof D_ParseNodeUser
     \item \bold{save_parse_tree} - whether or not the parse tree should be save once the final actions have been executed
     \item \bold{dont_fixup_internal_productions} - to not convert the Kleene star into a variable number of children from a tree of reductions
     \item \bold{dont_merge_epsilon_trees} - to not automatically remove ambiguities which result from trees of epsilon reductions without actions
     \item \bold{dont_use_greediness_for_disambiguation} - do not use the rule that the longest parse which reduces to the same token should be used to disambiguate parses.  This rule is used to handle the case (if then else?) relatively cleanly.
     \item \bold{dont_use_height_for_disambiguation} - do not use the rule that the least deep parse which reduces to the same token should be used to disabiguate parses.  This rule is used to handle recursive grammars relatiively cleanly.
     \item \bold{dont_compare_stacks} - disables comparing stacks to handle certain exponential cases during ambiguous operator priority resolution.
     \item \bold{commit_actions_interval} - how often to commit final actions (0 is immediate, MAXINT is essentially not till the end of parsing)
     \item \bold{error_recovery} - whether or not to use error recovery (defaults ON)
   }
