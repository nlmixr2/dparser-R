Matthew,

You submitted too soon, so the incoming check systems did not have
-Wstrict-prototypes turned on yet, and did not catch the remaining

Found the following significant warnings:
  lr.c:27:15: warning: function declaration isnâ€™t a prototype [-Wstrict-prototypes]

Should be in place now, can you please fix the remaining warning too?

* Fixed
